What is down there in the ocean?

Smithsonian points out that even at 13,000 feet below the surface, where temperatures are 
near freezing and there’s no sunlight, researchers have discovered living creatures such as fish, coral, crustaceans, jellyfish and worms.
The ocean floor has the same general character as the land areas of the world: mountains, plains, channels, canyons, exposed rocks, and sediment-covered areas.

Are there any cities at the bottom of the ocean?

The remains of at least a dozen lost cities rest eerily at the bottom of the ocean near places like Greece, Japan, and India. 
The sunken palace of Cleopatrais one of the most fabled underwater remnants of the ancient world. It was cast into the sea of when 
an earthquake and a tsunami hit Alexandria, Egypt, more than 1,400 years ago.

What happens if you die at the bottom of the ocean?

Because it’s so cold, the person would experience severe hypothermia, and the body would eventually 
stop working because of the cold temperature, but this is probably not what would kill them. (2) There’s no air. 
You can’t breath at the bottom of the ocean. If you can’t breath, your body won’t stay alive for more than about 30 minutes.

the mariana trench is 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi) in width. The maximum known depth is 10,984 metres (36,037 ft)

why is the ocean scary?

That's right, a body of water that 39 percent of the American population lives within a mile of is the 
most terrifying thing in existence. For starters, we've barely explored any of it. And the parts we actually have explored 
are full of murderous monsters, diabolical natural forces, and otherworldly-seeming black holes. Yeah—black holes aren't solely relegated to space.
remember, we have only explored 5% of it. that means the majority of the animals are still undiscovered.

New windows 11 build 22567

Windows Update will try to schedule update installations at specific times of day when doing so results in lower 
carbon emissions. Most electrical grids are powered by multiple sources, including renewables and fossil fuels. 
Whenever possible, Windows 11 will now prioritize installing updates in the background at times when greater amounts of 
clean energy sources (like wind, solar, and hydro) are available. Users can always choose to install updates immediately by 
navigating to Settings > Windows Update and choosing “Check for Updates”.
In October, Microsoft introduced subscription management within “Your Microsoft account” under Settings > Account. 
This enabled you to view your OneDrive storage, recurring billing and sharing information as part of your
Microsoft 365 subscription within Windows 11.
Microsoft is introducing payment details within the subscription card experience. This will allow you to view your 
payment information and be notified when your payment method needs to be updated, allowing you to continue your subscriptions 
without any disruptions.
You can now link your Android phone to your PC as part of the device setup (OOBE) for Windows 11. 
Linking will give you instant access to everything on your phone, right from your PC. Without needing 
to constantly swap your attention to your phone, you can use your favorite mobile apps, send text messages, 
make calls, and more on your PC with the benefit of a full keyboard and mouse.
Smart App Control (SAC) is a new security feature for Windows 11 that blocks untrusted or potentially dangerous 
applications. SAC can only be enabled on Windows devices that have performed a clean install with the latest Insider 
Preview build (Build 22567 and higher). SAC is first configured in evaluation mode. While SAC is in evaluation mode, 
it will learn if it can help protect you without getting in your way too much. If so, it will automatically be turned 
on. Otherwise, it will automatically be turned off.  While in evaluation mode, a user can manually turn on SAC in the 
Windows Security app under the App & Browser Control section. More details on this feature will be shared in the future.
Microsoft has also revamped the “Open with” dialog box to align with Windows 11 design principles. The updated 
dialog box honors light/dark theme. We have also simplified the experience by making it possible to update your 
default app with just one click.
When you hover one pinned app icon over another, there will now be a small animation to hint that this will create a folder.
Microsoft is updating multi-finger touch gestures to include responsive and delightful animations that follow your finger.

Tor 11.5a5 released!

3-3-22: This version includes important security updates to Firefox.
Tor Browser 11.5a5 updates Firefox to 96.3.0 and includes bugfixes and stability improvements. 
Notably: Tor fixed a bug that was preventing users of Android Q and later from downloading files.
Tor also used the opportunity to update various components of Tor Browser, bumping Tor to 0.4.7.4-alpha and 
NoScript to 11.3.4, while switching to the latest version of Go (1.17.7) for building Tor's Go-related projects.

Arti 0.1.0 Released!

2-3-22: Tor's embed'able client in Rust. today, Tor reached 0.1.0 milestone: this means that Tor now 
considers Arti's high-level APIs to be "mostly stable", and ready for experimental embedding in other projects. 
(Tor doesn't promise no API breakage, but Tor doesn't break your high-level APIs without a good reason.) The 1.0.0 milestone, 
scheduled for September, will represent an even stronger API commitment.
the primary new features are Tor's builder API for constructing TorClient instances, and the ability to create 
unbootstrapped and bootstrap-on-demand TorClient instances. These features make it easier to create a "lazy" 
TorClient that bootstraps itself in the background the first time it's used: Tor provided some example code to show you how.
Tor has also replaced it's error APIs.  Previously, it exposed a huge mass of APIs from lower-level crates, and encouraged 
dependencies on unstable lower-level error types. Now the error details are hidden, and there is instead an explicitly supported 
ErrorKind type that programs can use to see what type of error occurred. (You can still access the low-level information by 
enabling an optional trait, if you really want to.)

1-3-22: Hacker group Modified Elephant APT found injecting 'evidence' into computers

in Sept. 2021, A hacker group named EGoManiac wasplanting incriminating evidence 
on the systems of journalists to justify arrests by the Turkish National Police. A similiar 
hacker group called ModifiedElephant APT does similiar things.
The objective of ModifiedElephant is long-term surveillance that at times concludes with the 
delivery of ‘evidence’—files that incriminate the target in specific crimes—prior to conveniently coordinated 
arrests. In the last decade, they have targeted Activists, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, 
and law professionals. They send phishing emails to the victims. Their primary delivery mechanism is malicious 
Microsoft Office document files weaponized to deliver the malware of choice at the time. 
The specific payloads changed over the years and across different targets. However, some notable trends remain.

In mid-2013, the actor used phishing emails containing executable file attachments with fake double extensions (filename.pdf.exe).
After 2015, the actor moved on to less obvious files containing publicly available exploits, such as .doc, .pps, 
.docx, .rar, and password protected .rar files. These attempts involved legitimate lure documents in .pdf, .docx, and 
.mht formats to captivate the target’s attention while also executing malware.
In 2019 phishing campaigns, ModifiedElephant operators also took the approach of providing links to files hosted 
externally for manual download and execution by the target.
As first publicly noted by Amnesty in reference to a subset of this activity, the attacker also made use of 
large .rar archives (up to 300MB), potentially in an attempt to bypass detection.
Observed lure documents repeatedly made use of CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-1761, CVE-2013-3906,
CVE-2015-1641 exploits to drop and execute their malware of choice.
The spearphishing emails and lure attachments are titled and generally themed around topics relevant to the 
target, such as activism news and groups, global and local events on climate change, politics, 
and public service. A public deconstruction of two seperate 2014 phishing emails was shared by Arsenal Consulting in early 2021.
ModifiedElephant continually made use of free email service providers, like Gmail and Yahoo, to conduct their campaigns.
The phishing emails take many approaches to gain the appearance of legitimacy. This includes fake body content 
with a forwarding history containing long lists of recipients, original email recipient lists with many seemingly 
fake accounts, or simply resending their malware multiple times using new emails or lure documents. Notably, in specific 
attacks, the actor would be particularly persistent and attempt to compromise the same individuals multiple times in a single day.

By reviewing a timeline of attacker activity, we can observe clear trends as the attacker(s) rotate infrastructure over the years.
The malware most used by ModifiedElephant is unsophisticated and downright mundane, and yet it has proven sufficient for their 
objectives–obtaining remote access and unrestricted control of victim machines. The primary malware families deployed were NetWire 
and DarkComet remote access trojans (RATs). Both of these RATs are publicly available, and have a long history of abuse by threat 
actors across the spectrum of skill and capability.

One particular activity revolves around the file Ltr_1804_to_cc.pdf, which contains details of an assassination plot 
against Prime Minister Modi. A forensic report by Arsenal Consulting showed that this file, one of the more incriminating pieces of 
evidence obtained by the police, was one of many files delivered via a NetWire RAT remote session that we associate with ModifiedElephant. 
Further analysis showed how ModifiedElephant was performing nearly identical evidence creation and organization across multiple unrelated 
victim systems within roughly fifteen minutes of each other.
ModifiedElephant also sent multiple phishing emails containing both NetWire and Android malware payloads at the same time. 
The Android malware is an unidentified commodity trojan delivered as an APK file (0330921c85d582deb2b77a4dc53c78b3).

While the Android trojan bears marks of being designed for broader cybercrime, its delivery at the same time as 
ModifiedElephant Netwire samples indicates that the same attacker was attempting to get full coverage of the target on 
both endpoint and mobile. The full report contains further details about the Android Trojan.
Attributing an attacker like ModifiedElephant is an interesting challenge. At this time, we possess significant evidence of what 
the attacker has done over the past decade, a unique look into who they’ve targeted, and a strong understanding of their technical objectives.

We observe that ModifiedElephant activity aligns sharply with Indian state interests and that there is an observable correlation 
between ModifiedElephant attacks and the arrests of individuals in controversial, politically-charged cases.
