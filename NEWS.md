Tor's GsoC projects

29-5-22: Tor made a new project for the GsoC. This project will bring back Tor Weather. It is an email notification 
service that relay operators can subscribe to and choose which notifications they want to receive about their relay.
The second is OONI Detecting port based blocking. This project is about researching and developing new network 
experiments to be integrated inside the OONI Probe CLI. The contributor will write network measurements code and 
unit/integration tests for OONI's measurement engine.
The third is OONI Explorer. This project will improve OONI Explorer. Specifically improvements on the OONI Explorer 
country pages to enrich them with data coming from new experiments and make use of new backend API calls to display
more rich information about blocking. Moreover this work will entail modernizing the code base, improving the user 
interface, fixing usability issues, and writing more unit/integration tests.
All the projects are great for DN users.

Oxy dealer gets arrested

A man from Akron, Ohio, was sentenced to 62 months in prison for attempting to possess and distribute 
counterfeit oxycodone pills.Acting U.S. Attorney Michelle M. Baeppler 
announced that Thomas Anthony Walker, Jr., 36, of Akron, Ohio, will be 
spending 62 months in prison for attempted possession with intent to distribute fentanyl. Walker pleaded guilty to the charge 
in November 2021. 
Postal Inspector Marc Kudley, while working at the USPS Processing & Distribution Center in Akron, Ohio, identified a 
USPS Priority Mail Express package as “a suspect drug parcel based on several characteristics, including but not limited 
to the type of mail, origin, destination, and size.”
The Postal Inspector described the package as “a brown USPS Ready Post Mailing Carton with “Seal It. Sent It.” 
tape over the top and bottom seams.” The package measured 15” X 12” X 10”, weighed about five pounds, and bore $111.40 in U.S. 
Postage. Inspector Kudley searched CLEAR for information about the person who had mailed the package and the intended 
recipient. The return address did not exist. The recipient’s name, “T. Lewis,” was also fake. CLEAR reported that Walker, 
who had a previous conviction for heroin possession, lived at the address listed on the package.
After a very complicated failed delivery, he got arrested.
A very common type of arrest.

UK Dark web drug dealer sent to jail for selling Xanax pills

A member of a “global darkweb organized crime group” has been sentenced to nine years in prison 
for shipping kilograms of drugs to buyers around the globe.

Mubinar Rahman, 26, mailed more than 104 packages of MDMA to global destinations as a part of an organized 
darkweb drug trafficking operation, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). The defendant pleaded 
guilty at Newcastle Crown Court in October 2020 to trafficking drugs and possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.
Between June 29, 2020, and July 27, 2020, the NCA and Border Force intercepted 39 packages shipped by Rahman. he had 
addressed the packages to buyers in the UK, United States, Israel, Norway, Thailand, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. The 
investigation resulted in seizures of 90 kilograms of MDMA, 134 kilograms of amphetamine, and more than 6,000 
Valium and Xanax pills. In total, the value of the drugs shipped by Rahman was $1,036,025 (or 6,590,367 CNY/59,694,066 INR).
“Today’s sentencing is the result of our agencies’ exemplary collaboration to hold criminals on the dark web accountable 
for illegally selling and shipping narcotics overseas and putting countless individuals in danger.
We will continue to work together to keep drugs off our streets and our communities safe.” says the US 
Homeland Security Investigations. 
The investigation involved cooperation with the United States Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
On 28 July 2020, NCA officers watched Rahman park his 2010 BMW outside a house associated with the drug trafficking 
operation. Officers arrested Rahman after he had returned to his car. During a search of the BMW, officers found 
ten packages addressed to international customers. A subsequent search of the house resulted in the discovery of 
25 kilograms of MDMA, 134 kilograms of amphetamine sulfate, packaging equipment, and other materials often used by drug 
traffickers.

Why Did The Pringles Mascot Change?

The original Mr. P has had six makeovers since the brand's launching, although this rebrand marks the first change in 20 
years in the UK. Pringles brand design director Pete Matthews says that retaining this “iconic look and feel” was fundamental 
in the refresh. Mathews also adds that “The intention with the new look is to simplify and modernize the design, giving the 
brand’s mascot a bold makeover and highlighting the stickability of the crisps across the range.”
One of the most perceptible changes to the logo is Mr. P’s hair loss. However, Pringles says that “at 54 years old, he is 
still looking as handsome as ever” and that the makeover is Mr. P’s “boldest look yet”.

A Brief History of Music And Its Influence On The Human Mind

Humans used different noises and sounds to express their emotions like fear or joy. These sounds, along with some of the sounds 
they heard from animals, such as birds’ 
chirping, might have led them to make music.
When people began to use tools, for instance to pound grains, they may have done so in a rhythm, or a regular pattern. 
These sounds might have led them to make other pleasing 
rhythms with the first percussion instruments.
Music has a powerful impact on human beings. It can boost memory, build task endurance, lighten your mood, reduce anxiety and 
depression, stave off fatigue, improve your response to pain, and help you work out more effectively.
Working with a music therapist is one effective way to take advantage of the many benefits that music can have on your body, mind, and overall health.

Dread V3 is here!

the dark web forum, Dread is back online. The update, Dread V3, includes some of the most significant changes in Dread’s history. 
The most obvious and perhaps most welcome
changes include new captchas. The developers of Dread–HugBunter, Paris, and whoever else–reworked the 
site’s search function to include a full-text index of Dread’s 2+ million posts, suggestions, fuzziness adjustments, 
and various search operations. Dread V3 provides several avenues through which Dread can generate income, including a premium 
membership and a shop with trophies. Upvoting or downvoting a post or comment no longer refreshes the page. Fully analyzed 
text search of over the 2 million public posts and comments on Dread.
With this search layer there is quite a few features that you will be familiar with already if you have used any 
advanced search engine. All results are indexed in lowercase which means it doesn’t matter if you type in “MDMA” 
or “mdma” they will show the same results. If you want a specific phrase in the result you put them in quotes 
(“texting example”). If you want multiple specific words to be included but not in a certain order you can do
something like (“texting” “example”). If you want the root of the word to be search and synonyms to be searched 
with them you simply search without quotes and separate word with spaces (testing will also turn up results with just test).
There are self adjusting suggestions. If you accidentally type in “mdna” you will see a single suggestion which is 
based on the frequency of a word within the index. It will identify the closest match for simple typos but it will 
not correct multiple word phases or provide synonym suggestions like other search engines on the dark web.
It is a never ending battle to control bots on Dread. As everyone hopes we made well clear we would rather 
die than pay any asshole to stop spamming. There is only so much a bot master can do being that we control 
the whole site. There is many different things we do to prevent bots. We took that up to 11 this time. 
It personally doesn’t make sense to me why they would waste their time with us but that’s that. 
Within your account area there is a referral link system now. When registration is locked down you can refer 
others to dread. Dread, and dread’s search, will always be free to browse if you don’t want to register an account. 
We will not stop the information flow to those who don’t want to take the time to solve the captcha.
Dread’s new captcha is finally here. We tried multiple revisions of the regular captcha but they are all broken by 
machine learning. A machine is better at classifying these objects than regular humans. The new one uses a 
combination of human intention, fancy css, and basically unlimited unsorted images. The goal, make the photos 
straight like it was you on the ground taking a photo. You do this by pressing the rotate button to a point 
which changes the orientation of the image. DO NOT OVERSHOOT IT, reset and try again if you do so. Rotate 
just enough to stabilize the orientation. There are some images which are impossible to know the orientation 
of. Answer them anyway and as more people fail them these images the system will be clean them up. As new 
images are added every day there will always be some of these images. It’s a trade off to prevent bots from 
taking control. When this one does get broken we have another one lined up and one after that one as well. 
Like before as your account gets more activity and you have viewed more things (in an order which a human 
would do) captchas should disappear for your user account within 2 weeks of use. The more captchas you 
solve correctly (and incorrectly) after a certain point will give the system enough confidence to just 
not show your captchas anymore.

Windows users may need to be more careful after NVIDIA hack

NVIDIA's Certificates used to identify official software has been leaked by Lapsus$.
As reported by BleepingComputer, the compromised signing certificates expired in 2014 and 2018, respectively. 
However, Windows still enables drivers to be authorized with these certificates. As a result, malware can be masked 
by them in order to appear trustworthy, subsequently paving the way for harmful drivers to be opened in a Windows PC without being detected.
Certain variations of malware that were signed with the aforementioned Nvidia certificates were discovered on 
VirusTotal, a malware scanning service. The samples that were uploaded found that they were being used to sign hacking 
tools and malware, including Cobalt Strike Beacon, Mimikatz, backdoors, and remote access trojans.
One individual was able to use one of the certificates to sign a Quasar remote access trojan. In another case, a Windows driver was signed by a 
certificate, which resulted in 26 security vendors flagging the file as malicious as of the time of this writing. 
David Weston, director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, commented on the situation on Twitter. He stated that an admin 
will be able to configure Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies in order to manage which specific Nvidia driver can 
be loaded onto the system. However, as BleepingComputer points out, being familiar with implementing WDAC is not a common trait among the average Windows user.
So what does this all actually mean for Windows users? In a nutshell, those who create malware can target individuals with malicious 
drivers that can’t be easily detected. They typically spread such files through Google via fake driver download websites. With this 
in mind, don’t download any drivers from suspicious and untrustworthy websites. Instead, download them directly from Nvidia’s official website moving 
forward. Microsoft, meanwhile, is likely working on revoking the certificates in question and don't let your Grandma, Grandpa and/or kids on 
your device unless you want FREE_ROBUX_NOT_VIRUS_LEGIT.exe on your computer

Why Cats Are Superior Than dogs

Cats are incredibly brilliant due to 90 percent of their brains being structurally similar to a human brain - more than dogs - which 
makes them better at solving complex 
problems. Cats are also low maintenance, and less troublesome. When a cat falls out of a tree, there's no need to worry, for their legs were
designed to absorb shock and help 
in a graceful landing. The pitch and frequency of a cat's purrs are therapeutic and quicken the body's natural healing 
process, as well as decreasing the risk of suffering from 
a stroke. Felines have always been important and glorified just as much as they are now, if not more. So 
man's  best fried is a feline- not dogs. but their lifespan takes a blow from this though. cats can
live for 15 years but dogs can for 20 years and humans can for 79-122 years.

Samsung data leaked

Samsung has allegedly suffered a major security breach, with hackers claiming to have leaked approximately 190 gigabytes of 
data, including source code and biometric unlocking algorithms.
On Friday, the Lapsus$ hacking group published a 190-gigabyte trove of confidential data that it claims to have seized from 
Samsung Electronics. If genuine, the leak may be a big security problem for the Apple rival.
The data leak was originally teased by the group on Friday as including a snapshot of C/C++ directives in Samsung software, reports 
Bleeping Computer. The group then expanded on its description of the leak, saying it contained "confidential Samsung source code."
The code in question was said to include the source for every Trusted Applet in Samsung's TrustZone environment, 
which handles sensitive tasks such as hardware cryptography and access control. It also apparently includes biometric unlock operation algorithms, the bootloader 
source for recent devices, activation server source code, and the full source code used to authenticate and authorize Samsung accounts.
It is also thought to contain confidential source code originally from Qualcomm.
While the group has distributed the data leak via torrents, it is unknown how much more data the group had accessed. It is 
also unclear if the hackers attempted to secure a ransom from Samsung, though it did claim to demand one from Nvidia over a recent breach.
Samsung officials told the Korea Herald the company is assessing the situation.
The possible hacking incident is the latest of a number of recent issues for Samsung.
On February 28, it was reported that the company had shipped at least 100 million Android smartphones with a security 
flaw. The issue, relating to how cryptographic keys are stored in the TrustZone, could allow attackers to extract sensitive data from affected devices.
Samsung is also dealing with a scandal over throttling, with software limiting the performance of over 10,000 apps,
